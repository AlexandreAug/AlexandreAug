Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alexandre!

I'm a Electrical Engineer doing my Master degree in Space robotics.
With a passion for the undiscovered, sky, stars, planets and of course, robotics.
I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that challenge me and push the boundaries of what's possible.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on a project to contribute with the new space program with the objective that the robotic arm evades obstacles or possible obstructions.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Automated Rendezvous and Docking of Spacecrafts.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Electrical engineering, robotics, space and things similar to these themes.
